## YOLOv4: Optimal Speed and Accuracy of Object Detection [1]<a name="1"></a>
This 4th version has been recently introduced in April 2020 by Alexey Bochkovsky et al. in the paper "YOLOv4: Optimal Speed and Accuracy of Object Detection". The main goal of this algorithm was to make a super-fast object detector with high quality in terms of accuracy.

## DeepFaceDrawing: Deep Generation of Face Images from Sketches [2]<a name="2"></a>
You can now generate high-quality face images from rough or even incomplete sketches with zero drawing skills using this new image-to-image translation technique! If your drawing skills as bad as mine you can even adjust how much the eyes, mouth, and nose will affect the final image! Let's see if it really works and how they did it.

## High-Resolution Neural Face Swapping for Visual Effects [6]<a name="6"></a>
Researchers at Disney developed a new High-Resolution Face Swapping algorithm for Visual Effects in the paper of the same name. It is capable of rendering photo-realistic results at megapixel resolution. Working for Disney, they are most certainly the best team for this work. Their goal is to swap the face of a target actor from a source actor while maintaining the actor's performance. This is incredibly challenging and is useful in many circumstances, such as changing the age of a character, when an actor is not available, or even when it involves a stunt scene that would be too dangerous for the main actor to perform. The current approaches require a lot of frame-by-frame animation and post-processing by professionals.

## GPT-3: Language Models are Few-Shot Learners [8]<a name="8"></a>
The current state-of-the-art NLP systems struggle to generalize to work on different tasks. They need to be fine-tuned on datasets of thousands of examples while humans only need to see a few examples to perform a new language task. This was the goal behind GPT-3, to improve the task-agnostic characteristic of language models.

## Beyond the Nav-Graph: Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments [15]<a name="15"></a>
Language-guided navigation is a widely studied field and a very complex one. Indeed, it may seem simple for a human to just walk through a house to get to your coffee that you left on your nightstand to the left of your bed. But it is a whole other story for an agent, which is an autonomous AI-driven system using deep learning to perform tasks.

## Neural circuit policies enabling auditable autonomy [19]<a name="19"></a>
Researchers from IST Austria and MIT have successfully trained a self-driving car using a new artificial intelligence system based on the brains of tiny animals, such as threadworms. They achieved that with only a few neurons able to control the self-driving car, compared to the millions of neurons needed by the popular deep neural networks such as Inceptions, Resnets, or VGG. Their network was able to completely control a car using only 75 000 parameters, composed of 19 control neurons, rather than millions!

## Is a Green Screen Really Necessary for Real-Time Portrait Matting? [23]<a name="23"></a>
Human matting is an extremely interesting task where the goal is to find any human in a picture and remove the background from it. It is really hard to achieve due to the complexity of the task, having to find the person or people with the perfect contour. In this post, I review the best techniques used over the years and a novel approach published on November 29th, 2020. Many techniques are using basic computer vision algorithms to achieve this task, such as the GrabCut algorithm, which is extremely fast, but not very precise.
